Create a complete sports carpooling (CovoitSport) web application with frontend, backend, and a fully functional database. The main features and user flow must include:
Homepage: Presents the platform overview and purpose, with a clear, user-friendly design. Include a button to watch a demo video of the dashboard.
User Registration: Allow new users to register as either a club, association, or company. Ensure the registration process captures essential information.
Login: Registered users can log in and are redirected to their personalized dashboard.
Dashboard: After login, users (clubs, associations, or companies) access a dashboard to manage carpooling events and their profile. The dashboard should have:
Editable user profile fields suitable for the organization type.
Event management capabilities to create and manage both one-time and recurring events.
When creating an event, users can add or invite members by email.
Members can have roles: passenger or driver.
Passengers have a "passenger" status in the member list.
Drivers must specify the number of available seats in their vehicle (between 1 to 7).
Invitations: Email invitations must include a link directing invitees to a dedicated site page. This page should:
Auto-fill email, meeting location, and event location.
Allow the invitee to enter their name and select their role.
If the role is "passenger," notify the event creator and automatically add the member to the event.
If the role is "driver," display a seat selector to indicate available seats.
Messaging System: An integrated messaging area on the dashboard where members can send messages to event creators. Example uses include:
Informing the creator about inability to attend (allowing the creator to remove the member).
Suggesting additional drivers or other event-related communications.
Responsiveness and Usability: The entire platform must be responsive, intuitive, and provide an excellent user experience on all devices.
Competitor Reference: The platform should match or exceed the features and design quality of https://www.coolrool.com/.
Technology Stack: Generate frontend code (React), backend code (Node.js/Express), and a database schema (SQL or NoSQL) ready to be deployed.
